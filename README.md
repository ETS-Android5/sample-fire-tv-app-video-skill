# Readme

This sample-fire-tv-app-video-skill project, which is a fork of [Fire App Builder](https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder), integrates an Alexa video skill to provide voice interactivity with the media. Although the sample app is simple, it shows Amazon Device Messaging and the Alexa Client Library integrated, and once configured, plays up a video when you ask Alexa for the video by title.

This sample app will allow you to see a directive pushed to the app. This preview can give you more of a sense of how the video skill will interact with your app. The sample app does not show logic about how to handle the directives to perform specific actions in the app. You'll need to work out much of the logic on your own based on your own unique code.

Additionally, this sample app is meant as a companion to the documentation, not as a starting point or template for your own app. Almost every video partner that integrates a video skill already has a custom-developed app already. The sample app simply provides some context for some of the integration instructions.

For details on setting up the sample app, see the related documentation on the Amazon Developer Portal:
